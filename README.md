# Problem-Solver
1. Introduction:

Problem Solver is a project that is written in C. It is a collection of all the basic problems that we get in our university Programming Fundamentals course as assignments. 

2. Scope:

It is a basic project that can be used to solve various C problems.

3. Module Description:

This project consists of 7 files other than pre-compiled headers. These files are:

- 3 header files
- 3 assignment files
- main file

Most of the assignments include pointers either its necessary or not, just for the sake of practice. You can do it without pointers as well. We have a main file in which we have a switch statement that executes the problem according to the user entry. The header files contain a prototype of all the functions that are to be called in main. The code of these functions is written in the assignments file respectively.

4. Hardware/Software Requirements:

- Dev C++
